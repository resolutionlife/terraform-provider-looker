# looker_role_groups (Resource)

This resource binds a set of groups to a looker role.  This is an **additive and non-authorative** resource that grants groups to a role **in addition** to current groups configured in Looker.

~> **Note:** `looker_role_groups` **cannot** be used in conjunction with another `looker_role_groups` if they grant privilege to the same role, otherwise they will fight over what groups should be set.

## Example Usage 
```terraform
  data "looker_role" "writer" {
    name = "Writer"
  }

  resource "looker_group" "writers" {
    name = "Writers"
  }

  resource "looker_group" "directors" {
    name = "Directors"
  }

  resource "looker_role_groups" "writer" {
    role_id   = looker_role.writer.id
    group_ids = [looker_group.writer.id, looker_group.directors.id]
  }
```
