## Schema

### Required

- `data_type` (String) Type of user attribute ('string', 'number', 'datetime', 'yesno', 'zipcode', 'advanced_filter_number', 'advanced_filter_datetime', 'advanced_filter_string', 'relative_url')
- `hidden` (Boolean) If set the value will be treated like a password, and once set, no one will be able to decrypt and view it
- `label` (String) The user-friendly name displayed in the app for lists and filters
- `name` (String) The name of the user attribute, this is how you reference the attribute in Looker expressions and LookML
- `user_access` (String) If 'None', non-admins will not be able to see the value of this attribute for themselves. 'View' is required to use this attribute in query filters. If 'Edit', the user will be able to set their own value for this attribute, so the user attribute will not be able to be used as an access filter.

### Optional

- `default_value` (String) Value when no other value is set for the user or for one of the user's groups
- `domain_whitelist` (Set of String) A list of urls that will be allowed as a destination for this user attribute, optionally using a wildcard `*`. You must set this when changing a user attribute to `hidden`. Once set values can only be changed to be more restrictive. (I.e. removing elements from the list or changing an entry like `my_domain/*` to `my_domain/route/*`)

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique id of the user attribute
