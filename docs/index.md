# Looker Provider

The Looker Provider is used to create and manage resources within a single looker instance. The provider interacts with the [Looker API](https://developers.looker.com/api/explorer/4.0/) to configure an instance.

This provider supports Looker API version 4.

## Example usage

```terraform
provider "looker" {
  base_url      = "https://"
  client_id     = "my-client-id"
  client_secret = "my-client-secret"
}
```
~> Hard-coding credentials into any Terraform configuration is not recommended, and risks secret leakage should this
file ever be committed to a public version control system. See [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for a
better alternative.
